## Projects

### Project 1: Weather App

- **Description:** The Weather App is a Java-based web application that integrates with weather APIs to provide real-time weather information. It allows users to view current weather conditions, forecasts, and weather details based on user-specified locations.

- **Technologies Used:**
  - **Java Servlet:** Handles server-side logic and integrates with APIs to fetch weather data.
  - **JSP (JavaServer Pages):** Used for dynamic presentation of weather information and rendering HTML content.
  - **HTML:** Provides the structure and markup for the web pages.
  - **CSS:** Styles the HTML elements to enhance the visual presentation and user experience.
  - **JavaScript:** Enhances interactivity on the client-side, handling user inputs and dynamic content updates.
  
- **Features:**
  - Fetch and display current weather data including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
  - Search functionality to retrieve weather information for specific locations.
  - Display weather forecasts for the upcoming days.
  - Responsive user interface for seamless usability across devices.

## Learning Goals

My primary focus is mastering Java development and related technologies such as Spring Boot, Hibernate, and more. I aim to deepen my understanding of software architecture, data structures, algorithms, and best coding practices through each project.
